# Algorithms-1-Coursera
My submissions for the Algorithms-I course available on Coursera.
All the programs were created on IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.2. having [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) included as an external dependency.

To compile and run the file use following commands on terminal:
'javac-algs4 Percolation.java'
'java-algs4 Percolation'
